    "\n",
    "Most people are aware of how contagious diseases work. Some diseases have different levels of contagiousness as well as different levels of recovery. This means how easy or difficult it is to get infected by the disease and how easy or hard it is to recover from that disease, respectfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be working with different given parameters such as the probability of infection ($p_i$) and recovery ($p_r$) to show how a contagious disease can behave when also given a 200x200 grid where each cell (or coordinate) acts as a person. In order for a disease to be present, the center 4x4 (16 people) will be starting as the infected bunch. There will be four parts to show the analysis of the contagious disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cdot$ Part 1: The parameters $p_i$ and $p_r$ will be used slightly similar to check the behaviour of this disease. We will create a function called epidemics that takes in multiple parameters grid (200x200 grid), pi, pr, and vac. This function will return a new grid showing the new set of healthy, infected, and recovered people. To check when people get infected, we will use the particular function $1 - (1 - p_i)^k $, where $k$ is the amount of sick people.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cdot$ Part 2: We will create an animation function that will show the updated grid that the epidemics function returns. Basically the function will loop through the epidemics function using the updated grid and produce an animation that should show more people being infected and recovered (depending on $p_i$ and $p_r$) each time the epidemics function is looped.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cdot$ Part 3: This will be mainly an analysis part on how different values of $p_i$ and $p_r$ show how the disease can behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cdot$ Part 4: We mentioned earlier that the epidemics function takes a particular parameter called \"vac\". This variable will be equal to the percentage of people that get vaccinated in this 200x200 bunch. We will use this to show a different analysis of how the vaccine can change the behavior of the disease."

    "## Part 1: Epidemics\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to go more in depth of this epidemics function. We know it takes the parameters grid, pi, pr and vac. What epidemics will do, is contain a nested for loop that will loop through the rows and then loop through the columns of those rows if the grid parameter that the function takes. This will go through every single cell (or person) in this 200x200 grid and check if the person has been vaccinated, is healthy, sick or recovered. The value -1 means the person has been vaccinated, 0 means the person is healthy, 1 means the person is sick and 2 means the person has recovered. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will check for four different scenarios of each person:\n",
    "We create a grid called nextday. This is the grid that will update as well check each person.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cdot$ If the person has been vaccinated, they are immune to the disease (meaning that value can't be 0 or change to 1 or 2). To check if a person is vaccinated, we create a 200x200 grid to show different probablities that each person will get vaccinated. If that cell in the vaccinated grid is greater than or equal to \"vac\", then the corresponding cell in nextday gets vaccinated. Note: this vaccination is a one time thing, meaning no one else gets vaccinated after the first day.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cdot$ If the person is healthy, well then we have to check if this healthy person is surrounded by anyone who is sick to see if they can get sick. We use the particular function $1 - (1 - p_i)^k$ to calculate what the probability is that this healthy person can get infected. The higher the value of k, the more likely it is that this healthy person will get sick. To actually check if they get sick, we set this probability greater than or equal to a random decimal between (0,1). If this inequality is true, then the person gets sick and we change the value of the corresonding cell in nextday to 1. If not, then they stay healthy and we keep 0 in nextday.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cdot$ If the person is sick, then we start to check how likely it is that this person will recover. We use the inequality if pr is greater than or equal to a random decimal between (0,1), then this person has recovered and we change the corresponding cell in nextday to 2. If not, then the person is still sick and we keep 1 in nextday.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cdot$ If the person has already recovered, then we keep 2 in nextday. At this point, the person is also immune, so the value 2 can't change to any other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function will return the updated grid \"nextday\"."

Through the animation, you can see that every healthy cell gets sick very quickly. Basically, once a green cell is near a black cell, it will get sick quickly. You can also see a difference in the shape of how the disease spreads. Previously, the animation showed more of a circle expanding but now it is more of a square or rectangle expanding.

Although not every case is the same, somewhere around the 100th day, the peak was about 7000 people who were sick and the amount of sick people starts to drop significantly in this scenario where pi = 0.8 and pr = 0.1. We also notice that it took almost 200 days for everyone to be recovered. The printed values output also shows the specific number of sick people for each day until it reaches 0. These printed values represent what is on the graph and you will notice that each array starts with 16 and ends with 0, which represent the initial 16 sick people and the end of epidemic where no one is sick from this disease. \n",

High values of $p_i$ and $p_r$ create an epidemic where the disease is very contageous ($p_i$) but quick to recover from ($p_r$) and low values create an epidemic where the disease is not very contageous but hard to recover from. Eventually, we included a vaccine and we looked at how the vaccine can play a role in the behavior of an epidemic for a particular scenario. \n",

    "We have shown all of this through various animations and graphs. The animations give a visual on how the epidemic behaves, but we also wanted quantitative information, so we created a graph that shows the data regarding how many sick people there are for each day. The patterns and information on each graph reflects the animations of the cases we explored."
